# About me
My name is Gergely Pali, a Software Developer with around 10+ years of experience in testing and programming.<br />
My passion lies in understanding and analyzing complex problems or systems. This is why I love to read about various disciplines other than Computer Science, like
economics, politics and biology that are all describing complicated systems. I also love to play computer games, especially where I have to solve the problem it serves and min-maxing my own solution.<br />
My current path leads to game development, focusing on engine creation and gpu programming.

# Projects
During my career I have worked on several projects including
+ Telecommunication Application Server / charging subsystem
+ End-to-End 4G network
+ Telecommunication network's data correlator
+ Medical Device controller

During my Game Programming studies I created a few projects for classes, for example:
